-- | A data structure storing the state for evaluation of a given piece of brainfuck source code. Has:
-- * @readingIndex@, an @Int@ index of the source code at the current evaluation step
-- * @bracketMap@, a @Map Int Int@ lookup table for brackets and their pairs
-- * @sourceCode@, a @String@ of the brainfuck source code, with comments
-- * @tape@, a @Tape Word8@ of the current memory state of the system

-- | A monad that defines the IO actions that would happen with the interpteter
--
-- It has 3 methods:
-- * @recurseStandby@, called immediately prior to each recursive call
--   @[(Int -> Map Int Int -> String -> Tape Word8 -> m (Tape Word8)) -> InterpreterState -> m (Tape Word8)]@
-- * @writeInputFromTape@, called when the interpreter wants to write something to the tty @[Tape Word8 -> m (Tape Word8)]@
-- * @writeInputToTape@, called when the interpreter wants a user input (single character in) @[Tape Word8 -> m (Tape Word8)]@

-- If we want to have good (efficient) bracket jumps, we want to make a lookup table where a given index of a bracket is matched
--   with the index of its partner. This should be autopopulated.
-- We can have an index counter that recursively increases as we parse the string that we can outright change for jumps
-- Technically this is slower than a jump table with saved states, but it's both WAY easier to implement and notably more memory efficient
-- | Given a string, produces a @Just (Map Int Int)@ of each bracket and its partner (and vice versa), or Nothing if there is a broken pair
